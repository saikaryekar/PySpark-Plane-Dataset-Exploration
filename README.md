# PySpark Plane Dataset Exploration

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook where I've explored a dataset of planes while learning PySpark commands. The tutorial is designed for beginners and provides hands-on examples for learning basics of big data processing with PySpark.

## Contents

- **Introduction to PySpark**: Understanding the basics of PySpark and its key components.

- **Loading the Dataset**: Learn how to load a dataset into a PySpark DataFrame.

- **Data Exploration**: Perform exploratory data analysis using PySpark commands to gain insights into the plane dataset.

- **Data Cleaning**: Apply data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and other issues.

- **Basic Data Manipulation**: Practice basic data manipulation operations like filtering, grouping, and aggregating.
